	<h2>Summarize the popularity of JavaScript in Web Development</h2>
	<p>JavaScript is popular in web development because of its versatility. We can use JavaScript in both the front-end and the back-end. Furthermore, JavaScript has a great number of libraries to make the jobs of developers easier.</p>
