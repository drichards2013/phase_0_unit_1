# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
<ul>
	<li>The DOM is simply the model of how our HTML elements are outlined on the page. What's good about the DOM is that it allows us to find and manipulate our elements. I can't see anything bad about the DOM.</li>
</ul>
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
<ul>
	<li>The first thing I noticed was that I recognize the language that is being used on the Wordpress site. There are divs, classes, iframes, styles, borders, some comments, everything. The Wordpress site is far more complex, making use of even javascript to print information to the webpage. </li>
</ul>
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
<ul>
	<li>I find it to be Helpful because I can see the value of using it in the future.</li>
</ul>
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
<ul>
	<li>Nope.</li>
</ul>
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
<ul>
	<li>Nope.</li>
