# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
<ul>
	<li>Responsive web design is the process/idea of building web sites that consider where the user is viewing them from. The sites <i>respond</i> to the size and shape of the user's screen. This is an <b>excellent </b>practice; now, websites that were previously uncomfortable to view on mobile devices are not only the contrary, but also fun! </li>
</ul>
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
<ul>
	<li>Yes. Smartphones and tablets have changed web design. As more web-accessible devices are released the web will have to adapt to their specifications.</li>
</ul>
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
<ul>
	<li>Visually impaired people view the web through screen readers. Yes, we should design and develop the web to help them.</li>
</ul>
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
<ul>
	<li>I like the concept of using percentages as opposed to fixed values. My CSS needs some work, though.</li>
