# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
<ul>
	<li>I think the web standards are fine right now.</li>
</ul>
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
<ul>
	<li>The standard structure makes sense. The head goes at the top, the body is in the middle, headers go in the body, and paragraphs go under the headings. </li>
</ul>
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
<ul>
	<li>I like it because it makes markup more intuitive.</li>
</ul>
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
<ul>
	<li>It's not necessary, but we use it in order to override the default styles that HTML elements already come with.</li>
</ul>
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
<ul>
	<li>Though I swear by Google Chrome, I have used pretty much all the mainstream browsers (Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer) </li>
</ul>
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
