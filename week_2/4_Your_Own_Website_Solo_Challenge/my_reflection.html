# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
<ul>
	<li>Above all, I learned that design and user experience is <b>not</b> a one size fits all process. It must be tailored to each website's individual purpose and user base. I learned that it's important to create a natural flow of elements on the page so that the user's eyes effortlessly gaze in the direction in which we want them to.</li>
</ul>
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
<ul>
	<li>It was fun to see my site come closer and closer to what I outlined in the wireframe, but I don't really enjoy the process of A/B testing with UX.</li>
</ul>
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
<ul>
	<li>
		I took my wireframe and divided it into divs and classes. I made the entire HTML file first. Only after the HTML was done did I work on the CSS.
	</li>
</ul>
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
<ul>
	<li>I would like to make the color scheme better. I just don't know how to go about choosing colors that go well with each other. I would also like to have a photo gallery instead of static, boring images. I couldn't seem to get my big "Hey, I'm Dylan." text to resize with the page. I'd like to get that to happen as well.</li>
</ul>
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
<ul>
	<li>It wasn't difficult to apply what I'd learned. </li>
</ul>
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
