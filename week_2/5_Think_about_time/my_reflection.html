# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
<ul>
	<li>I haven't had any time management challenges during Phase 0 so far. </li>
</ul>
* How will you combat that?
<ul>
	<li>I don't think I should :o </li>
</ul>
* What techniques will you try?
<ul>
	<li>Well, I meditate 15 minutes a day twice a day right now and I've been using the Fogg Method to get things done for a few months.</li>
</ul>
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
<ul>
	<li>My overall plan for Phase 0 is to do the work and absorb as much as I can. I'm not looking to compare myself to the members of the cohort, but to how I was just a moment ago. If I'm better than before, then I know I'm on the right track. It's not a very specific plan, but it's all I need. Besides, we know well-defined plans don't work very well, anyway.</li>
</ul>
