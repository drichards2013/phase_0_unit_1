	<h1>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?</h1>

	
	<h3>The Box Model</h3>

	<p>
		The best way to explain border, margin, and padding is through the box model.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each HTML element is contained within a rectangular box. In the box model, the element would be found in the area marked <i>content</i>.
	</p>

	<p>The next most important thing to take note of is the border. Once we understand that elements are contained in rectangular boxes that have borders, we can begin to understand padding and margin.</p>

	<h3>Padding</h3>
	<p>Let's look at padding first. According to the box model, padding is the space between the border and the content. Therefore, the greater the padding, the more space between the content and the border.</p>

	<img src="http://self-paced-images.webucator.com/176.gif" alt="padding example" width = '60%'>

	<p>Again, padding is the space between the content and the border.</p>
	
	<h3>Margin</h3>
	<p>
		If padding is the space between the border and the content, then margin is the space between the border and elements outside the box.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the image above, Element A has a margin-right of some amount of pixels. It separates the right side of the box from Element B. 
	</p>

	<p>
		For the hell of it, take note of the fact that the boxes in the margin example have padding in them as well. It's what's separating the "Element A" and "Element B" text from the border of the boxes.
