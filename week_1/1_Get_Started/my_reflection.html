## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I didn't have any struggles setting up git and GitHub. It's something I've done a few times before. I learned a few things:
		<ul>
			<li>Version control is like a time machine. It allows us to go back in time in regard to changes to files. If we mess up, it's no big deal. We can return to the past. What's more is that we can see who made the change, collaborate on the same documents simultaneously and merge them at the end.</li>
			<li>The two most popular version control systems are Subversion(SVN), and Git.</li>
			<li>How to initialize repositories</li>
			<li>Branching allows us to fool around without making changes to the master branch. That said, when we're ready to stage and commit those changes, we are able to merge them into the master branch.</li>
			<li>GitHub is a website that allows users to host their repositories online.</li>
			<li>To use or contribute to a repository, you can fork it.</li>
			<li>To get your changes made on a separate branch to be incorporate into the master repository, submit a pull request.</li>
		</ul>
		
Here I'm going to explain the difference between Git and GitHub. When we save files regularly, we limit ourselves to only a single copy of the particular file. We have no other information about it. Git enables us to save our files and have access to information such as who made the change, what time it was made, where it was made, what exactly the change was, etc. GitHub simply lets people publish all their file history to the world so that other people can view, and, optionally, contribute to other peoples' code.
		
Put simply, version control is like a timeline for a file or set of files. It allows us to track, revert to, and fast-forward to different time perids of a particualra file or set of files. GitHub helps with this because it allows us to see this timeline in a visual way. The GitHub interface also makes it easy to quickly find what we are looking for.

Developers use version control for safety and accountability. Mess up? We've got a backup. Is something messed up? He did it.
		
Right now, everything makes sense.
