## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


To create a repository, go to github.com/new, and type in all the information regarding the repository you wish to make. Once you create the reposity, check the right side of your screen for the button that says "clone to desktop." Click that. Doing so will create a copy of the repository on your local machine.

Simply put, open source describes software that the author chose to make publicly readable, editable, shareable, and, oftentimes, sellable. 

I think open source is great. It's great because, well, it allows for more rapid development. The whole world can complete a project faster than a small team of developers can. Furthermore, for businesses, giving away software shows the world that the company is genuinely concerned with the problem it seeks to solved, allowing profit to take a backseat temporarily.

It is important to use licenses because they outline exactly what people can do with your software.

I'd always felt left out when watching tutorials and RailsCasts videos: "This is released under the MIT licence." What the heck are licenses? All I really knew is that it meant I would be able to use the software for whatever I wanted to use it for -- that is, I didn't even have to look deeply into the doctrines of the licenses. I knew that what I was doing wasn't going to breach any legalities (haha).

Nope.
