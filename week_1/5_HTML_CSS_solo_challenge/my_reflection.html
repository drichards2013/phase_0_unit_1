	<li>I had trouble recalling the pseudoclasses for links. I did a quick Google search and found my answer on W3Scools.</li>
	<li>I'm having trouble with absolute and relative positioning. What I did just figure out, however, was how to implement visided and hover effects on links.</li>
	<li>I learned how to style inline elements using spans! I've always seen it done on the web but never knew how to do this! Awesome!</li>
	<li>I'm confident with all of it except the absolute and relative positioning.</li>
	<li>I enjoyed making the spans of text different colors and adding an image to the page for some life. The border was nice to add. It immediately created a different feel for the web page. </li>
	<li>I didn't particularly enjoy positioning using absolute and relative. I know it's because I'm not good at it. I'll get better with practice.</li>
