Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

	Eh... I felt like I was stating the obvious. The process of looking at a site and writing down what I see wasn't interesting. I think my work reflects that, too. Wasn't cumbersome, though. Blogs are a great tool for learning, which is why I started blogging personally last month. I felt best about taking the time to appreciate Google's site. I think it goes without question that <a href="http://www.google.com">Google.com</a> is minimal and complex at the same time, bringing the world to our fingertips with a square box and a search button.

	I think I'm comfortable with this topic (using the learning competencies as a guide).
