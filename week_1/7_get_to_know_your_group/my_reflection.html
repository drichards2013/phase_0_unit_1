	<li>Learning style: According to VARK, it's <i>multimodal</i>, but if I didn't have to place a label on my learning style, I'd say that I learn best by doing -- doing what I can, then asking for help when I get stuck. This way I get assistance in precisely the area I need it. I also enjoy figuring out the answer myself as opposed to being told the answer directly. This is usually done through questions like: "Okay so you know this. What does this mean for you, and how does it help get to the next step?" I felt motivated to answer the technical challenge during the application interview. Lloyd Nimetz was an awesome facilitator.</li>

2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

<ul>
	<li><b>"How far have you gotten with the Phase 0 work? I'm struggling a bit."</b></li> One of the members in my accountability group said this. It made me drop my guard a bit because it made me realize how <i>similar</i> we are to one another. As per Sam Blackman, "We're all in this together."
	<li><b>Getting to know my accountability group</b> made me feel good because no longer is Dev Bootcamp an application, series of problems and challenges, or emails, but <i>real</i> people with their own goals, aspirations, and lives to live.</li>
	<li><b>I'm excited</b>.</li>
</ul>
