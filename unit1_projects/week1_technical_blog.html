	<h1>Favorite Websites</h1>
	<div class="date">
		<p><small>By Dylan Richards on Wednesday, April 23</small></p>
	</div>
	<p>Here are the websites I am going to analyze:</p>
	<a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> |
	<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> | 
	<a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>

	<h2>Breakdown</h2>
		<div class="sidebar">
			<h2>Some sidebar</h2>
		</div>
		 <ul>
			<li class='sitename'>Facebook</li>
			<li>This is one of my favorite websites because it allows me to keep in contact with people who I don't see every day.</li>
			<li>My eyes are immediately drawn to the center -- the News Feed. After standing back, my eyes still drawn to the same place.</li>
			<li>Simple, cluttered, basic, clean, interactive</li>
			<li>The problem this site solves is lack of communication</li>
			<li>Fun, serious, interaction, memorable, random</li>
			<li>It's very easy to scroll down and view status updates</li>
			<li>I feel bored and unproductive after being on the site for a while</li>
			<li>I don't believe Facebook itself sells anything to social users, but I believe developers can pay Facebook to host games on its platform. That said, I have purchased countless game enhancements for Candy Crush.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li class='sitename'>Google</li>
			<li>Google is one of my favorites sites because it puts the entire world at my fingertips. The answers to most of the questions I pose can be found in a Google search result</li>
			<li>My eyes are drawn straight to the center of the page, where the search bar is located. It's practically the only thing on the page. When I step back, my eyes fixate in that direction. It is, indeed, the most important area of the site</li>
			<li>Simple, minimal, basic, terse, effective</li>
			<li>The website decreases the amount of time it takes for one to find the information he/she needs </li>
			<li>Practical, informational, random, funny, serious</li>
			<li>It's very easy to find what I'm looking for on Google. Everything's organized in a linear fashion</li>
			<li>As easy as scrolling your mouse downward is</li>
			<li>Interesting... I don't really know how I feel when I'm on Google for a long time. Perhaps it's beacuse I don't use Google for Google, per se, but for the results it provides</li>
			<li>Like Facebook, Google doesn't sell anything to the typical user; however, it does sell ad space to developers</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li class='sitename'>Reddit</li>
			<li>Reddit is one of my favorite seites because it contains tons of exciting and interesting information about <i>everything</i>.</li>
			<li>My eyes are drawn to the center of the page -- where all the content is.</li>
			<li>Light, cluttered, square, complex</li>
			<li>This website allows people from all over the world to discuss whatever they want in focused groups.</li>
			<li>Funny, creepy, interesting, weird, scary </li>
			<li>For a beginning user, it's pretty hard to find what you're looking for on Reddit.</li>
			<li>This is pretty easy, though. Once you find the content you're looking for, all you've gotta do is scroll down.</li>
			<li>Reddit sells what's known as <em>Reddit Gold</em>. It costs a few bucks and it allows users to show anonymous appreciation for users who post excellent content. Reddit Gold gives the recipient added features on the site. </li>
		</ul>
	<h2>What I learned from completing these analyses</h2>
	<p>I think the two major takeaways here are that</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If you want your users to recognize some content before others, place it in a largeer div, centered on the page (Facebook).</li>	
		<li>Or you could take the other route and make it the <strong>only</strong> thing on the page.</li>
	</ol>
