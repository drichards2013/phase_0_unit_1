	<h2>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?</h2>
	<p>The video got me even more pumped and excited for the DBC experience. This is the culture I've been waiting to be a part of. I've never seen or heard of a learning environment so immersive and driven. I am in love with the encouragement to take control of our own educations, as opposed to viewing Dev Bootcamp as some sort of package. Naturally, I am nervous. I want to make sure I get the best out of the DBC learning experience -- really squeeze out every drop of experience I can.</p>
