		<h1>Howdy there!</h1>
		<h2 id='top'>I'm Dylan Richards!</h2>
		<h3>And this?</h3>
		<h4>Well, it's my</h4>
		<h5>Introduction page.</h5>
		<h6>Let's proceed <small>(wow this is really small)</small></h6>
		

		<h2>The basics</h2>

		<p>I'm 19 years old. I'm from Long Island and am an undergraduate student at The University of Connecticut (UConn).</p>

		<p>I'm attending Dev Bootcamp because I think it's the most direct way for me to learn the craft of programming and web development. I've hacked away for many months (years with some technologies), and I've reached a point where it's difficult to progress alone -- especially with school.</p>

		<p>I've got a blog. It can be found <a href="http://www.dylanerichards.com" target='_blank'></a>here. I'm particularly proud of it because it does exactly what I want it to do and I use it on pretty much a daily basis.</p>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Tennis</li>
			<li>Running <small>(though I haven't been doing much of it lately)</small></li>
			<li>Meditation</li>
			<li>Photography</li>
			<li>Public Speaking</li>
			<li>Programming/Web Development</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I feel compelled to add a section for my dog, Murphy. He's my best friend, my companion.</p>

		<h2>Some other stuff</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>I alphabetize words -- like <i>a lot</i>. If you give me a word, say 'emergency', I can alphabetize the letter in that word pretty quickly. Ceeegmnry. See? Only problem, though, is that when the word exceeds 11 letters, my speed drops <b>substantially.</b></li>
		</ol>
