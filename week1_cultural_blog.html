	<h2>Release 2</h2>
	<h3>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</h3>

	<p>
		I'll choose <em>inner harmony</em>. I wouldn't say that I'm 100 percent inwardly harmonious, but what I will say is that these past few weeks have been phenomenal for me. It's been an incredible learning and eye-opening experience (Eckhart Tolle, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Russell Simmons and Chade Meng Tan)
	</p>
	<p>
		The reason this value is important to me is because it allows me to approach people and situations with positivity and optimism. It also allows me to separate emotion from reason and observe situations with enhanced clarity.
