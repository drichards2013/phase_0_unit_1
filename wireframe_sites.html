      <p><b>What problem is the web page solving? What visual challenges are there?</b></p>

      <p>
      	Facebook's layout is designed to present the user with as many social features as possible, in a way that is comfortable for the reader. The visual challenge here is the sheer number of features that are thrown at users on their dashboards.

      <p><b>What problem is the web page solving? What visual challenges are there?</b></p>
